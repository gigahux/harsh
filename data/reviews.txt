I absolutely loved this movie! The performances were stellar and the story was gripping.
The film was boring and I wasted two hours of my life.
An excellent portrayal of the protagonist's journey. Highly recommended.
Terrible script and poor acting. Not worth watching.
A masterpiece that redefines the genre.
I didn't like the movie at all. It was too long and uninteresting.
